Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components. 

JSON is different from Javascript as it a text-based format, in this project it is used to send data from the code to the website. The text-based format is easy for humans to read and understand its functionality. Javascript is a programming language that can have methods and implement logic, whereas JSON cannot. JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by having a common data format that can easily take the data from the backend, and display it on the frontend.

The benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components is that it makes coding quicker and easier. It also ensures that the format matches more which makes the user experiance better. 


When testing of API endpoints I used HTTP request methods, such as GET, POST, and PUT. The testing allowed me to see if the code was working as it was intended. For example, I used the HTTP request method of GET to retreive a trip, and POST to send data over of a trip onto the website server. Testing is neccessary so when I added a "Add Trip" button, I knew the functionality of the button. Overall, GET is used to retrieve data, POST is used to send over new data to the server, and PUT is used to update or edit existing data. The security in a full stack application can be accomplished by using authentication and JTW to ensure only authorized users can access specific parts of the website that may hold sensitive data or in this case the ability to add a new trip or edit existing trips. 


This course has helped me in reaching my professional goals by giving me more hands-on experiance with building a website. I really enjoyed learning how to do this and seeing it finished and running at the end of the class. I have learned the MEAN stack and how it can be used to create a website. Another skill I have learned in this class is debugging. This class helped me improve my debugging skills within a code. Although each assignment for developing the website had a step by step guide, chapter 7 had some issues and I had to figure out how to fix them. This was definitely a challenge but it improved my debugging skills which I can carry into my career in computer science.
